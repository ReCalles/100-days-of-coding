## About This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to document my daily progress, store all the code I write, and build a portfolio of projects. Each day of the course has its own dedicated folder, containing the relevant exercises, projects, and my personal notes. This serves as both a reference for myself and a showcase of the skills I'm acquiring.
